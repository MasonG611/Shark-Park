Shark Park is to be a smart parking station for SharkCycles

2021-2022 Team Proton Members: Vincent Bruno, Mason Glenn, Canaan Lockridge, Ramon Tillman

Repository includes working FinalRaspberry.py and many test files for various stages of the project.
Also includes FinalLinka.py which worked previously with Arduino Nano and Serial USB

To Future SharkPark teams:

We have included our final report as well as our final presentation in the repository for your use. In the final report, the last section is 
future works which is our suggestions for your team. Some of these are relatively easy fixes/changes, others are more complex. We hope the code
we've included as well as the documentation helps you all in your development efforts. 

Good Luck!
